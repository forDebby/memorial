She then came to York U, where she soon moved into activism on the socialist left and into campus unionism as well. Undergoing a series of intellectual and political shifts, she asked me to supervise her Ph.D. thesis on the political economy of indigenous oppression in Canada.

Deb also connected with the great Métis Marxist, Howard Adams, and brought him into contact with many of us on the Left in Toronto in the early 2000s. Deb was personally tough and resilient but had an eternally soft, kind heart. She toughed it out as an itinerant academic, largely in Manitoba, for some years. But the academy never really suited her. Like so many smart, outspoken women, she never found her place there. Increasingly, she gravitated to life in the Far North.
