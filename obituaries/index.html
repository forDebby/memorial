        Deborah Lee Simmons was born in Ajo, Arizona, in 1962, to Hilah (teacher) and Norman (biologist) Simmons.
        Followed two and a half years later by brother David, she began her teaching career early with this new
        sibling who, though not the best student, thrived under her tutelage. It was not long before she started
        ‘organizing’ her family.
        We
         were an unruly lot but that did not stop her from trying.
      </p> <p>
        In ‘66 the family packed the station wagon and moved to Ft. Smith in the Northwest
        Territories,   an idyllic little town on the banks of the Slave River. Early formative experiences
        include the summers spent on the banks of the Keele River in the Mackenzie Mountains where Deb was first
        introduced to the Northern “bush”. Norman was doing research on Dall Sheep for the Canadian
        Wildlife Service supported by three Mountain Dene families from Tulita, a town on the Mackenzie River. Their
        guidance was essential to the success of his research, providing expert knowledge on the land, its wildlife
        and its people. The Simmons clan was treated like family and had the unique opportunity to learn about the
        traditional skills, stories and philosophies of the Sahtú Dene. These experiences likely inspired
        what would ultimately become Deborah’s mission in the North, namely to support and strengthen Dene
        culture, language, and self-governance; and to ensure the participation of the Dene people in the management
        of their natural resources.
      </p> <p>
        The year 1973 brought her brother Daniel into the fold. In 1975 the Simmons family moved
        further north to Yellowknife on the shore of Great Slave Lake and a few months later her sister Sarah was
        born.
      </p> <p>
        During this time, Deb distinguished herself both as a top student and through her many
        extra-curricular interests such as cross country skiing, camping, and canoeing, the latter a favourite
        family activity. Her mother Hilah surrounded the family with music and Deb learned piano and played french
        horn, then flute, in the Sir John Franklin High School band. Between these pursuits she could almost always
        be found with a book in hand. She was an absolutely voracious reader. In school, Deb befriended the quirky,
        talented and interesting kids, a trait that would continue throughout her life as evidenced by her sprawling
        network of unique individuals.  Her love of languages inspired her to do a French immersion semester in
        Caraquet, New Brunswick. At graduation, Deb was second in her class and selected as Valedictorian.
      </p> <p>
        Deb’s post-secondary career was the ground of her true flowering as a thinker, writer, activist,
        and teacher. She was a committed socialist with a vision to build a just society for all by advancing and
        amplifying the voices of the dispossessed. Following the completion of her PhD Dissertation on the political
        economy of Indigenous resistance in the S
        ocial and Political Thought program at York University
         in Toronto, she went on to teach at the University of Manitoba.
      </p> <p>
        After this stint in academia, Deb returned to her childhood roots with a job as a social science
        researcher in the Sahtú region, working with some of the same families that her father had worked
        with decades before.
        Picking up the baton from him, she advocated for the full participation of the Dene in conservation and
        land management.
         Her principled commitment to indigenous self-determination brought her, ultimately, to the
        position of Executive Director of the Sahtú Renewable Resources board. In this role, she was able to
        effect lasting change, notably by having t
        he co-management of natural resources recognized as a right within the framework of land claims
        agreements
        . Along with her tireless struggle to have indigenous rights recognized by the legal
        authorities that would rule the land, she championed Dene ways of knowing and being, namely by integrating
        Dene language and oral histories through all projects in which she was involved.
      </p> <p>
        Her colleagues within academic, professional, and activist circles have spoken beautifully of
        Deb’s tireless work ethic, commitment to her ideals and innate good nature (see below). Her capacity
        to organize and network, along with her joyous and kind spirit, drew many to her.  Though always
        gentle, she was never deterred. This magnetic energy surely emanated from her huge heart.  
      </p> <p>
        Deborah was a pillar of her family and will be sorely missed. She is survived by her mother
        Hilah, her partner Morris, her siblings and their children. She was a fun and loving auntie not only to Ruby
        and Sadie, (Sarah), and Noah, Hilah and Remi (Danny), but also to Morris’ niece Jennie and to many
        young people in the Sahtú on whom she made a lasting impact. In her life, cut far too short, Debby
        passionately planted many seeds that already are blooming. May she be remembered not only for her legacy but
        for the irrepressible joy and passion she brought to bear throughout her life.

        "Last week, I lost a dear friend, Deborah L Simmons, to cancer.
      </p> <p>
        In October 2018, Michael and I spent a night at the Simmons’ ranch near Pincher Creek, Alberta. We awoke to
        beautiful blue skies and softening early season snow. Deb suggested that we snowshoe up the ridge so we could
        really see the Gladstone Valley, the place her parents had made their home after leaving the North and a place
        that was equally special for her. I questioned the suggestion—Deb was in the middle of chemotherapy—but she
        assured me she felt up for it. I should not have worried. She bounded up the ridge, leaving me scrambling to
        catch up.
      </p> <p>
        I have told the story of that hike many times because it captured something of who Deb was: a person with
        limitless energy and enthusiasm; a person with the sunniest of dispositions, unwavering optimism, and a lust
        for life; a person with a deep love for the land and its caretakers; and a person who was happiest when others
        were along for the ride, even if it meant she had to help them get where she was going.
        Like so many in Debby’s network, we were colleagues first. We met in December 2016 when I was working at the
        NWT Recreation and Parks Association, supporting on the land programs. She approached me about doing some
        safety planning work with the leadership team for the first Dene Ts’ı̨lı̨ School. I explained my reticence
        about using conventional risk management tools for land-based programs. Deb liked the idea of seeing if we
        could do things differently. Over the next few years, we worked alongside Dene and Métis elders, knowledge
        keepers, and youth to develop a plan for the Sahtú Renewable Resources Board that was grounded in and
        regenerated Dene and Métis knowledges and practices related to safety. I learned so much through the process
        from Deb about how to be a good ally, as I watched her create space for discussion, ask good questions, listen
        intently, carefully document terms and concepts in Dene Kǝdǝ́, and laugh at herself.
        I was fortunate to be able to continue to work with and learn from Deb on a number of projects that were dear
        to her, including the Sahtú Nę K’ǝ́dıkǝ́ - Keepers of the Land guardian program; the public listening
        sessions on conserving caribou; the Sahtú COVID-19 response evaluation; and most recently, the petroleum
        histories project. The thread through these topically diverse projects was upholding Indigenous
        self-determination and governance and revitalizing land connections.
      </p> <p> I loved how Deb’s brain worked, even if I struggled to keep up. I loved her curiosity, which extended into
        so
        many disparate realms. I loved (and shared) her zeal for fifty per cent off food and free books. I loved that
        when she developed a passion for something, whether it was kefir, a bidet, vermicomposting, or a Biolite
        stove, she became a proselytizer on par with the most fanatical of religious acolytes (Deb managed to convince
        me of the value of all of these things). Maybe more than anything, I loved her laugh, and I worked hard to
        hear it whenever we were together.
      </p> <p> Michael and I visited the Gladstone Valley again this fall, this time with our son, Arn. From the time that
        Deb learned I was pregnant, she was a doting auntie, checking in on me by text and asking to see my growing
        belly during our Zoom calls. When he arrived in June, she fawned over photos and videos until she was finally
        able to cuddle him in person in August. I’m so thankful that Deb and Arn met each other; I’d like to think
        that in their three visits, he soaked up enough Auntie Debby love to last a lifetime.
        Losing Deb has been so hard. I’ve taken comfort in spending time with others who knew her and reading posts
        from people in her vast network. I’ve been thinking of all of the things that Deb still wanted to do and I
        hope that I can help realize some of those visions, but maybe even more importantly, I hope that in my life
        and work, I can walk as she did, lightly, with passion and a spring in her step, and with deep respect and
        love for land and people."

        and
        lived there again for most of the years since 1999. Some of you will know her from her years in Toronto￼ from
        the late 1980s until 1995, others from her time in Winnipeg (2004-2006). Debbie was an amazing person, as
        capable in intellectual matters (her regrettably unpublished dissertation on the political economy of
        Indigenous resistance in Canada is excellent) as she was on the land, befriending people in a way that
        reflected her wide range of interests, generous, outgoing, energetic.
        She was a friend and comrade of mine since the early 90s in Toronto, and I was so happy when she moved to
        Winnipeg a year after I did. After two years she decided to leave academic work and go back to living in the
        north, which in spite of her urban cosmopolitan side was, I think, where she was most at home."</p> <h4>David Camfield</h4></div> <div class="astrodivider"><div class="astrodividermask"></div><span><i>✶</i></span></div> <div class="o-entry"><p>
        "Deborah L Simmons was a wonderful client and friend who was deeply committed to improving co-management of
        wildlife and other natural resources in the Sahtú.
        Deb was relentless in her work, mustering an energy level that never ceased to amaze me. We pulled more than
        one all nighter together working on hearings and reports for the Ɂehdzo Got’ı̨nę Gots’ę́ Nákedı (Sahtú
        Renewable Resources Board / SRRB).
        Deb followed in her father's footsteps as Executive Director of the SRRB, doing ground-breaking work to help
        realize their shared goal of genuine Indigenous sovereignty over wildlife and resources in the Northwest
        Territories.
        While a force to be reckoned with in her work, Deb was a kind and gentle soul who was an incredible friend and
        mentor to myself and many others. She was very thoughtful in her efforts to connect people, and always seemed
        to see the bigger picture in her work and activism.
        I will miss her laugh, her creativity, and the joyful energy she brought to her life and work."

        "I am so saddened by this news. Deborah L Simmons was a unique and wonderful woman, as sweet yet as strong as
        a
        person could be. A committed and brilliant socialist, Deb was equally passionate about wildlife – and about
        the wellbeing and future of the Dene people she worked with (taking after her father Norm). The last chapter
        of her working life was as Executive Director of the Ɂehdzo Got’ı̨nę Gots’ę́ Nákedı (Sahtú Renewable
        Resources Board) in the Northwest Territories beginning in 2012. She kicked ass, and always had a blast doing
        so. Rest In Power, Deb!"

        "Rest in power Debbie Simmons. The wonderfully sweet, smart, feisty and dedicated socialist, feminist,
        anti-racist and fighter for indigenous rights died in Pincher Creek, Alberta last night. In the late 1980s,
        Deb had gobbled up deconstruction, earning an A+ from Jacques Derrida as a Masters student in a course at
        Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. She then came to York U, where she soon moved into activism on the
        socialist left and into campus unionism as well. Undergoing a series of intellectual and political shifts, she
        asked me to supervise her Ph.D. thesis on the political economy of indigenous oppression in Canada. It remains
        a landmark piece of historical materialist research. Deb also connected with the great Métis Marxist, Howard
        Adams, and brought him into contact with many of us on the Left in Toronto in the early 2000s. Deb was
        personally tough and resilient but had an eternally soft, kind heart. She toughed it out as an itinerant
        academic, largely in Manitoba, for some years. But the academy never really suited her. Like so many smart,
        outspoken women, she never found her place there. Increasingly, she gravitated to life in the Far North. Many
        of us from "the old days" had only the most distant contact with Debbie in recent years. But she remained in
        our hearts. And there she will remain, with her boisterous laugh, her impish smile, her big, big heart, and a
        passion for social justice that will never burn out. Rest in power dear comrade."

        tenacity and dedication to her work is incomparable, her courage and strength is undeniable, she’s changed the
        face of wildlife management in the sahtu and has tried to revitalize the dene language, she’s done amazing
        work and has shown so much compassion for the people of the sahtu, my thoughts and prayers go out to her

        everyone’s posts about her. Her passing has hit me a lot harder than I expected.
      </p> <p>
        She meant a great deal to me and I will be forever grateful to her. She always believed in me, especially when
        I didn’t. She called me a few days after I left Calgary because she knew that I felt guilty about leaving her
        for work. She told me how important my work is and to continue fighting for our people. I’ll do my best not to
        her her down.❤️"

        Well my friend ... I am having to say goodbye much too soon. You have both inspired and frustrated me as you
        pushed me to expand my often narrow mind and perspectives ... I see you smiling and hear you laughing because,
        while you may have driven me to distraction, you have always known I usually need a push to see clearly. As
        found family and a heart relation, I will treasure our all too-short visits and our last call. I shall miss
        you ... but I know your intellect, grace, strength, and beauty of heart and soul will live on.

        "I raised my head and set myself, In the eye of the storm, in the belly of a whale, My spirit stood on solid
        ground, I'll be at peace when they lay me down .... When they lay me down someday, My soul will rise, then fly
        away, This old world will turn around, I'll be at peace when they lay me down.
