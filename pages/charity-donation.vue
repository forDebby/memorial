      <p>In lieu of flowers, please consider donating to Debby’s charitable initiative:</p>
      <h3>Dene Ts'ı̨lı̨ - Dene Way of Life Fund</h3>

      <p>
        Debby knew that spending time on the land is critical to the ongoing regeneration of Indigenous knowledge and
        practices, which are in turn critical to Indigenous self-determination. She also knew that there are all sorts
        of barriers to spending time on the land. To address these barriers, including gaps in available funding, Deb
        established the Dene Ts’ı̨lı̨ - Dene Way of Life Fund.
      </p>
      <p>
        Debby’s vision for this Fund was to support young people to become capable and confident living on the land. Your
        support will allow Dene and Métis youth from across the Sahtú region to spend time on the land living with, and
        learning from, elders and knowledge holders, and in doing so, will help bring Debby’s vision to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        In memory of Deborah Simmons, donations will be matched up to a total of $500,000.
