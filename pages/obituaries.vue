          "We have lost our beloved sister, daughter and aunt Deborah after an incredible fight with cancer. She
          maintained her optimism until close to the end and never wavered in her kindness towards all around her. She
          had the strength to bless us with her beautiful smiles to almost the last. What an amazing soul. What luck to
          have her on this earth with us."

        <p>"Deborah L Simmons (1962-2022)’s death is such a loss. She grew up in Denendeh (the Northwest Territories)
          and
          lived there again for most of the years since 1999. Some of you will know her from her years in Toronto￼ from
          the late 1980s until 1995, others from her time in Winnipeg (2004-2006). Debbie was an amazing person, as
          capable in intellectual matters (her regrettably unpublished dissertation on the political economy of
          Indigenous resistance in Canada is excellent) as she was on the land, befriending people in a way that
          reflected her wide range of interests, generous, outgoing, energetic.
          She was a friend and comrade of mine since the early 90s in Toronto, and I was so happy when she moved to
          Winnipeg a year after I did. After two years she decided to leave academic work and go back to living in the
          north, which in spite of her urban cosmopolitan side was, I think, where she was most at home."</p>

          "Deborah L Simmons was a wonderful client and friend who was deeply committed to improving co-management of
          wildlife and other natural resources in the Sahtú.
          Deb was relentless in her work, mustering an energy level that never ceased to amaze me. We pulled more than
          one all nighter together working on hearings and reports for the Ɂehdzo Got’ı̨nę Gots’ę́ Nákedı (Sahtú
          Renewable Resources Board / SRRB).
          Deb followed in her father's footsteps as Executive Director of the SRRB, doing ground-breaking work to help
          realize their shared goal of genuine Indigenous sovereignty over wildlife and resources in the Northwest
          Territories.
          While a force to be reckoned with in her work, Deb was a kind and gentle soul who was an incredible friend and
          mentor to myself and many others. She was very thoughtful in her efforts to connect people, and always seemed
          to see the bigger picture in her work and activism.
          I will miss her laugh, her creativity, and the joyful energy she brought to her life and work."

          I am so saddened by this news. Deborah L Simmons was a unique and wonderful woman, as sweet yet as strong as a
          person could be. A committed and brilliant socialist, Deb was equally passionate about wildlife – and about
          the wellbeing and future of the Dene people she worked with (taking after her father Norm). The last chapter
          of her working life was as Executive Director of the Ɂehdzo Got’ı̨nę Gots’ę́ Nákedı (Sahtú Renewable
          Resources Board) in the Northwest Territories beginning in 2012. She kicked ass, and always had a blast doing
          so. Rest In Power, Deb!

          Rest in power Debbie Simmons. The wonderfully sweet, smart, feisty and dedicated socialist, feminist, anti-racist and fighter for indigenous rights died in Pincher Creek, Alberta last night. In the late 1980s, Deb had gobbled up deconstruction, earning an A+ from Jacques Derrida as a Masters student in a course at Trent University in Peterborough, Ontario. She then came to York U, where she soon moved into activism on the socialist left and into campus unionism as well. Undergoing a series of intellectual and political shifts, she asked me to supervise her Ph.D. thesis on the political economy of indigenous oppression in Canada. It remains a landmark piece of historical materialist research. Deb also connected with the great Métis Marxist, Howard Adams, and brought him into contact with many of us on the Left in Toronto in the early 2000s. Deb was personally tough and resilient but had an eternally soft, kind heart. She toughed it out as an itinerant academic, largely in Manitoba, for some years. But the academy never really suited her. Like so many smart, outspoken women, she never found her place there. Increasingly, she gravitated to life in the Far North. Many of us from "the old days" had only the most distant contact with Debbie in recent years. But she remained in our hearts. And there she will remain, with her boisterous laugh, her impish smile, her big, big heart, and a passion for social justice that will never burn out. Rest in power dear comrade.

          "Hard to imagine that this woman won’t be around anymore, she’s been such a force to be reckoned with, her tenacity and dedication to her work is incomparable, her courage and strength is undeniable, she’s changed the face of wildlife management in the sahtu and has tried to revitalize the dene language, she’s done amazing work and has shown so much compassion for the people of the sahtu, my thoughts and prayers go out to her family, Rest In Peace Deb Simmons, your legacy will never be forgotten."
